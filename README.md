# My current commitments

I am currently unemployed and it's the holiday period, so I don't have any ongoing commitments at the moment. This gives me the flexibility to dedicate significant time and focus to this opportunity. I do not have any financial obligations that would interfere with my ability to fully engage in this program. 

With this available time, I can prioritize my learning and ensure that I meet the requirements of the course while still being able to manage my personal commitments. As I do not have any pressing responsibilities, I can dedicate a substantial portion of my day to this opportunity, ensuring that I stay on track and make the most out of this experience.

# The importance of doing your own work

Copying other people’s work is a damn silly idea because it might help you get a quick pass, but it doesn’t help you in the long run. If you don’t understand what you’re doing, you won’t be able to solve real problems when they come up. When you start a job, you will face situations where you need to apply what you’ve learned on your own. If you haven’t learned the material properly, you’ll get stuck. People will notice that you don’t actually know what you’re doing, and it will affect your job performance and future opportunities. The goal is to learn and grow, not just to get by.

Taking the time to fully understand concepts is a good idea because it helps you build a strong foundation. When you understand how things work, you can think for yourself and find solutions to problems, even ones you haven’t seen before. This will help you in any job because every project or task might be different, and you need to adapt. If you take the time to learn and understand, it makes learning new things easier, and you become more confident in your skills. It also helps you be more independent and less dependent on others to solve problems. So, while it might take longer now, understanding the concepts will make you a much better coder and professional in the future.
